## Usage

## Fetch and convert to AZW3 (Kindle Format)

The following command pull the chapter

	python fetch_book.py url_of_chapter number_of_chapters number_chapter_start_downloading name_of_ebook

Parameters :

* url_of_chapter : The URL of the chapter (not of the story homepage!)
* number_of_chapters : You guessed. If you want the whole book, just enter something like 99999
* number_chapter_start_downloading : From which chapter will it start downloading, for download all juste enter 1
* name_of_ebook : The name of the ebook, .html extension will be added when the file is written on the filesystem.

It reads the chapter content of the URL given ( url_of_chapter ) and goes to the next chapter, and it loops number_of_chapters times.

This command will give you a file ```name_of_ebook.html``` on your filesystem, that can be used through Calibre to be directly pushed to your Kindle.


## Fetch, convert, and push to your device :

	fetchAndCopy.py url_of_chapter number_of_chapters number_chapter_start_downloading name_of_ebook

This script will download the chapter and push it to the first kindle detected. ```name_of_ebook``` is the name of the ebook which will be visible.
